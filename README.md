Unleash your inner artist and utilize our sprite editing tool for easy sprite creation and animation!

This project was created for my CS 3505 class to practice C++ QtCreator, waterfall software development,
and UML class diagrams. I worked with my team members Braden Fiedel, Caden Erickson, and Connor Blood. An
